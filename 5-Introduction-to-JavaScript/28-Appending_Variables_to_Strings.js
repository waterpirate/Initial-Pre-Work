//Summary: This section gave me an understanding of building a string and appending multiple variables to it using the " += " operator.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = 'test';
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
