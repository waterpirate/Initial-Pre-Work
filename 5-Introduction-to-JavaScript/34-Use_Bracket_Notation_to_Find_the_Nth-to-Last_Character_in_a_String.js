// Summary: This section gave me an understanding of using bracket notation with .length added to the variable name. The number sequence for the identifier number, which reads the characters from right to left, is used in its place.


// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
