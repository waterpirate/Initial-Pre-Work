//Summary: This section gave me an understanding of being able to modiify and add to the contents of a variable by using the " += " operator". This operator can register mathematical operations and assignment in a single step.

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a = a += 12;
b = b += 9;
c = c += 7;
