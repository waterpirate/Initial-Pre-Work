// Summary: This section gave me an understanding of building and adding more variables to a string using the Mad Libs style.


// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "David Womack";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!;"
