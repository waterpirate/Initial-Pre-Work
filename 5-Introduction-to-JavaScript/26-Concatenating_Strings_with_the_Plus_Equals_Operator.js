//Summary: This section gave me an understanding of using the " += " together in order to concatenate a string within a variable.


// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
