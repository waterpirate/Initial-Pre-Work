// Summary: This section gave me an understanding of using the concatenation operator in order to assign and display multiple quote indentations within a sentence.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
