// Summary: This section gave me an understanding of using bracket notation within a string to enter a character to find by choosing the numerical value placement of that character. 

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
