//Summary: This section gave me an understanding of finding the length of a string's value by using the .length command right after the variable's name.

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

var lastnameLength =

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
