// Summary: This section gave me an understanding of building and nesting an array inside another array which is referred to as an Multi-dimensional Array.

// Example
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [["test", 1], ["test 2", 2]];
